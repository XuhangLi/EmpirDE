Description: This package performs the two-pronged differential expression (DE) analysis used in the Worm Perturb-seq (WPS) technology. This WPS DE framework uses the concept of empirical null to robustly identify differentially expressed genes based on a large-scale RNA-seq dataset. The framework is not restricted to analyzing WPS data but also applicable to similar dataset with large number of conditions profiled.
