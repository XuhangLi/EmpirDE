Description: This package performs a two-pronged differential expression (DE) analysis that was initially designed for the Worm Perturb-seq (WPS) technology. EmpirDE uses the concept of empirical null to robustly identify differentially expressed genes of a large-scale RNA-seq dataset. The framework is not restricted to analyzing WPS data but also applicable to similar dataset with large number of conditions profiled.
